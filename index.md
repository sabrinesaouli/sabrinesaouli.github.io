# Sabrine Saouli
*PhD in Computer Science | SAT Solving | AI & Optimization*

## About Me
Currently an ATER at Sorbonne UniversitÃ©, I defended my PhD in December 2024. My research focuses on SAT solving and symmetry exploitation. I have experience in teaching programming (C, Python, Java) and data structures.

## Research
My PhD research explored symmetry-based optimizations for SAT solving, developing the CosySEL solver. I also worked on integrating genetic algorithms and AI techniques for CDCL solvers' initialization.
