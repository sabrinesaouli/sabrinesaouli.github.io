### √Ä Propos | About Me

Currently an ATER (Attach√©e Temporaire d'Enseignement et de la Recherche) at Sorbonne Universit√©, I successfully defended my PhD in Computer Science in December 2024. My research focuses on enhancing SAT solver performance through innovative techniques including symmetry exploitation, genetic algorithms, and machine learning approaches.

---

### Research Expertise

My doctoral research has led to several significant contributions to the field of SAT solving:

#### üîπ CosySEL: Symmetry-Based SAT Solving

I developed CosySEL, a novel approach that leverages local symmetries to improve SAT solver performance. This technique identifies and exploits symmetrical structures within SAT problems, significantly reducing search space and improving solver efficiency.

#### üîπ Genetic Algorithms for SAT Initialization

I developped, implemented and tested an approach using genetic algorithms to address the polarity initialization problem in CDCL solvers, demonstrating substantial performance improvements across various benchmark categories.

#### üîπ Machine Learning for Parameter Optimization

My most recent work implements MLP neural networks to predict optimal genetic algorithm parameters for SAT solvers, creating a hybridized approach that leverages both traditional and AI-based methods.
